## 🎨 Fun Fact

A fun fact about people with ADHD is that they often have a "hyperfocus" ability, which means that they can become intensely focused and absorbed in a task that they find interesting or enjoyable, often to the point of losing track of time. This can be a great asset when harnessed effectively, as it can lead to high levels of productivity and creativity. However, it can also be a challenge when it comes to completing less interesting or less enjoyable tasks.
