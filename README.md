# Namaste, I'm Rahul Talukdar 👋🏼  
### AI-Ready Web Engineer • Systems Builder • Product Thinker

I build **modern web systems** that are scalable, intelligent, and production-ready.  
By day I work as an **Automation Engineer**, by night I design and ship **next-gen web platforms, developer tools, and AI-powered products**.

I’m deeply interested in the future of software — where **AI, Web, Cloud and System Design** converge.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably riding my motorcycle through places with zero signal and full clarity 🏍️
